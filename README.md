# DFS-Sudoku
This Sudoku Solver uses an algorithmic technique known as depth first search (DFS) to solve any 9x9 sudoku puzzle. 
A few traditional sudoku solving techniques like hidden and naked singleshave been used to optimize the solving process.
The input uses zeros to represent blank spaces. The code will output the solved sudoku, or a 'No Solution' message if the sudoku is unsolvable.
